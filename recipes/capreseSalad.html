    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>2 c. balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>3 whole ripe tomatoes, sliced thick</li>
            <li>12 oz. mozzarella cheese, sliced thick</li>
            <li>fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil over medium-low heat in 
                a small saucepan. Cook for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the 
                balsamic has reduced to a thicker glaze. Remove it from the heat 
                and transfer to a bowl or cruet. Allow to cool.
            </li>

            <li>When you're ready to serve, arrange tomato and mozzarella slices 
                on a platter. Arrange basil leaves between the slices. Drizzle 
                olive oil over the top of the salad, getting a little bit on each 
                slice. Do the same with the balsamic reduction, making designs 
                if you want. Store extra balsamic reduction in fridge for a later 
                use.
            </li>

            <li>End with a sprinkling of kosher salt and black pepper. Serve as
                a lunch, with crusty bread, or serve alongside a beef main course 
                for dinner.
            </li>
