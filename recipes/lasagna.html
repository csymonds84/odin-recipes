        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven 
                over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, 
                tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 
                2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, 
                fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, 
                stirring occasionally.
            </li>

            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna 
                noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, 
                and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta 
                cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 
                and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 
                9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat 
                sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 
                1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce 
                over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. 
                Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan 
                cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil 
                with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the 
                cheese.
            </li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and 
                bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes 
                before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
