        </ul>

    <div class="steps">
        <ol>
            <li>Start by preparing this flaky pie crust recipe which makes 
                2 (9") pie crusts, one for the bottom and one for the top of the 
                pie. The pie dough will need to chill for at least 1 hour before 
                rolling out. Or use a store-bought pie crust and follow package 
                directions.
            </li>

            <li>Place oven rack in the center position and Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C).</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, 
                light brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice and 
                lemon zest; toss to coat evenly.
            </li>

            <li>Remove the pie crust dough from the fridge and let rest at room 
                temperature for 5-10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, roll one 
                disc into a 12" circle that is ⅛" thick. Carefully lay the crust into 
                the bottom of a deep dish pie plate.
            </li>

            <li>Spoon the apple filling over the bottom crust and discard juices at the 
                bottom of the bowl. Roll out the second disc of pie crust until it is 
                ⅛" thick and lay it over the apple filling.
            </li>

            <li>Use a sharp knife to trim the dough along the outside edge of the pie plate. 
                Lift the edges where the two pie crust meet, gently press to seal and fold 
                them under. Rotate the pie plate and repeat this process until edges are 
                neatly tucked under themselves. Cut 4 slits in the top of the dough to 
                allow steam to vent. Place the pie on a baking sheet.
